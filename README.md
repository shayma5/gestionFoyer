# University Chamber Reservation System

Welcome to the University Chamber Reservation System project! This system facilitates the reservation of chambers for households in universities. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing users, reservations, chambers, blocks, and university/foyer details.

## Project Description

The University Chamber Reservation System consists of several modules, each handled by different team members:

- **User Management** (Ons Khiari): Responsible for managing user accounts, authentication, and authorization.
- **Reservation Management** (Nour Ben Aissa): Handles the reservation process, including booking, cancellation, and modification of reservations.
- **Chamber/Block Management** (Shayma Ettayeb): Manages chambers and blocks within university premises, including availability, capacity, and amenities.
- **University/Foyer Management** (Montassar Mchabet): Oversees university and foyer details, such as location, contact information, and regulations.

## Technologies Used

The University Chamber Reservation System is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: Angular framework is used to develop the user interface, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience.
- **Backend**: Spring Boot framework is utilized to build the backend services, including RESTful APIs for data manipulation and business logic implementation.
- **Database**: MySQL database is employed to store user data, reservation details, chamber information, and other relevant data.
